# ABSTRACT: SHARYANTO's temporary namespace for various roles

=head1 FAQ

=head2 What is this?

This distribution is a heterogenous collection of roles currently used in my
modules and applications. The roles will eventually have their own proper names
and distributions, if they prove to be worth it.

See L<SHARYANTO> about this temporary namespace.
